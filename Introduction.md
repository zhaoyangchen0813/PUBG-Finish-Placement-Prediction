## Introduction

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left and standing, and all while the play zone continuous to shrink. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset, apply different feature engineering techniques, and predict target variable (Win Placement Percent) by building models.


## Data
The data was acquired from an active competition from Kaggle.com. The data set contains 4,446,966 samples, and each sample has 29 factors, target variable included. Data includeds players post game stats which are used to predict the target variable winPlacePerc.

winPlacePerc is the target variable. It represents players' finishing placement, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).
